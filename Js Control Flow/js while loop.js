JavaScript while and do...while Loop
JavaScript while Loop
The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

The syntax of the while loop is:

while (condition) {
    // body of loop
}
Here,

The while loop first evaluates the condition inside ( ).
If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside { } is executed.
Then, the condition is evaluated again.
This process continues as long as the condition evaluates to true.
If the condition evaluates to false, the loop stops.

Example 1: Display Numbers From 1 to 3
// initialize variable i
let i = 1;

// loop runs until i is less than 4
while (i < 4) {
    console.log(i);
    i += 1;
}
Run Code
Output

1
2
3
Here is how the above program works in each iteration of the loop:

Variable	Condition: i < 4	Action
i = 1	true	1 is printed. i is increased to 2.
i = 2	true	2 is printed. i is increased to 3.
i = 3	true	3 is printed. i is increased to 4.
i = 4	false	The loop is terminated.

Example 2: Sum of Only Positive Numbers
let num = 0, sum = 0;

// loop as long as num is 0 or positive
while (num >= 0) {

    // add all positive numbers
    sum += num;

    // take input from the user
    num = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number: "));
}

// last, display sum
console.log(`The sum is ${sum}`);
Run Code
Output

Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: -3
The sum is 6
The above program prompts the user to enter a number.

Since JavaScript prompt() only takes inputs as string, parseInt() converts the input to a number.

As long as we enter positive numbers, the while loop adds them up and prompts us to enter more numbers.

So when we enter a negative number, the loop terminates.

Finally, we display the total sum of positive numbers.

Note: When we add two or more numeric strings, JavaScript treats them as strings. For example, "2" + "3" = "23". So, we should always convert numeric strings to numbers to avoid unexpected behaviors.

JavaScript do...while Loop
The do...while loop executes a block of code once, then repeatedly executes it as long as the specified condition is true.

The syntax of the do...while loop is:

do {
    // body of loop
} while(condition);
Here,

The doâ€¦while loop executes the code inside { }.
Then, it evaluates the condition inside ( ).
If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside { } is executed again.
This process continues as long as the condition evaluates to true.
If the condition evaluates to false, the loop terminates.

Example 3: Display Numbers from 3 to 1
let i = 3;

// do...while loop
do {
    console.log(i);
    i--;
} while (i > 0);
Run Code
Output

3

1
Here, the initial value of i is 3. Then, we used a do...while loop to iterate over the values of i. Here is how the loop works in each iteration:

Action	Variable	Condition: i > 0
3 is printed. i is decreased to 2.	i = 2	true
2 is printed. i is decreased to 1.	i = 1	true
1 is printed. i is decreased to 0.	i = 0	false
The loop is terminated.	-	-

Example 4: Sum of Positive Numbers
let sum = 0, num = 0;

do {

    // add all positive numbers
    sum += num;

    // take input from the user
    num = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number: "));

    // loop terminates if num is negative
} while (num >= 0);

// last, display sum
console.log(`The sum is ${sum}`);
Run Code
Output

Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: -3
The sum is 6
In the above program, the do...while loop prompts the user to enter a number.

As long as we enter positive numbers, the loop adds them up and prompts us to enter more numbers.

If we enter a negative number, the loop terminates without adding the negative number.
