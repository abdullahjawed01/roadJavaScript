JavaScript Hoisting
In JavaScript, hoisting is a behavior in which a function or a variable can be used before declaration.

Here is a simple example of variable hoisting in JavaScript. Read the rest of the tutorial to learn more.

Example
// use test variable before declaring
console.log(test);

// declare and initialize test variable
var test = 5;

// Output: undefined
Run Code
Here, we can use the test variable before declaration because of variable hoisting. However, we get undefined as output because the variable hasn't been initialized at the time it's printed.

Hoisting in JavaScript
There are generally two types of hoistings in JavaScript:

Variable Hoisting
Function Hoisting
Let's understand each of them in detail.

Variable Hoisting
In JavaScript, the behavior of hoisting varies depending on whether a variable is declared using var, let, or const.

Hoisting With 'var'
When we declare a variable using var, it is hoisted to the top of its current scope. For example,

// use the message variable before declaration
console.log(message);

// variable declaration using var keyword
var message;

// Output: undefined
Run Code
In the above example, we can use the message variable before it is declared. This is because the variable is hoisted with the default value of undefined.

Thus, the above program is equivalent to:

var message;
console.log(message);

// Output: undefined
Run Code
Hoisting With 'let' and 'const'
When we declare a variable using let or const, it is hoisted to the top of its current scope. However, the variable does not have a default value when it is hoisted (unlike when declared using var).

Let's take a look at the example below.

// use the message variable before declaration
console.log(message);

// variable declaration using let keyword
let message;
Run Code
Output

ReferenceError: Cannot access 'message' before initialization
Here, the error occurs because a variable declared with let is not assigned any default value when hoisted.

Note: We know the message variable was hoisted because the error message "Cannot access 'message' before initialization" indicates that JavaScript is aware that message exists.

Had the variable not been hoisted, we'd get a different error, i.e., ReferenceError: message is not defined.

Function Hoisting
In JavaScript, function hoisting allows us to call the function before its declaration.

// function call
greeting(); 

// function declaration
function greeting() {
  console.log("Welcome to Programiz.");
}
Run Code
Output

Welcome to Programiz.
In the above example, we can call greeting() before it is declared because of hoisting.

Variable hoisting inside a function.





Function Expressions are not hoisted.


Initializations Are Not Hoisted
JavaScript moves the declaration of variables to the top of its scope before the code runs.

However, the initialization part stays in the original place in the code. For example,

// display number
console.log(number);
var number = 5;

// Output: undefined
Run Code
The above program is equivalent to:

var number;
console.log(number);
number = 5;
Run Code
As you can see, only the declaration is moved to the top.

Hence, the value of the number variable is undefined because it is printed without initializing it.

Notes:

Generally, hoisting is not performed in other programming languages like Python, C, C++, and Java.
Hoisting can cause undesirable outcomes in your program. So, it's best to avoid this practice.
